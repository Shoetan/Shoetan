## Hi there Friend😁


## 🙋🏽About Me:
I am a skilled software engineer with a background in full-stack development. Focusing on Golang, React, and the Cairo programming language. I am very familiar with building secure REST APIs, and Backends solutions, creating responsive front-end web applications.

On personal projects like PassIn, where I added encryption to protect user data, and Panda Eats, where I improved the online food ordering experience. I am confident in my ability to solve problems and deliver results as seen in the projects I have worked on.

Beyond my professional work, I contribute to open-source projects. Where I contributed to key features and tests for the Shinigami Bitcoin Script VM and Carbonable's protocol. 

I combine technical skills with a strong desire for learning and problem-solving. This allows me to break down complex challenges into small bits and deliver solutions that make a difference. I'm always eager to take on new projects and continue growing in this ever-evolving field.
